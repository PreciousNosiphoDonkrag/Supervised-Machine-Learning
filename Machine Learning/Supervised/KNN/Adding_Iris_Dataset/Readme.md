## Understanding the Iris Dataset<br>
The Iris dataset is found in the scikit-learn python library and it is widely used for machine learning models.<br>
The dataset consists of 150 observations of the iris flowers and 3 different types of irises'.<br> 
Each row in the dataset represents a flower. <br>

the following columns exist in the dataset:<br>
  *  Sepal Length <br>
  *  Sepal Width <br>
  *  Petal Length <br>
  *  Petal Width <br>
  *  Species of flower <br>

  The **iris_data** is a feature matrix from the iris data and ill be assigned to the variable x.<br>
  The **iris_target** is the target array and it contains classes and labels. This is what we will try to predict from input X. It will be assigned to the variable Y. <br>
